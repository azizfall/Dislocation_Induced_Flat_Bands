Dislon_Dispersion_Relation_Si_Master_3D.py will generate the dipsersion relation for the specified direction (i.e. k_angle in main function). The format of the outputed file is k: [Mag of k vector] E: root1,tol1 root2,tol2 .. where E is followed by
a list of the possible roots within some specified tolerance given by tol1, tol2, ... etc. 

Im_Self_Energy_Master.py generates the imaginary part of the dispersion relations from the corresponding files generated in Dislon_Dispersion_Relation_Si_Master_3D.py 

Random_Coulomb_Scattering.py is a simple test of the DCM Algorithm
